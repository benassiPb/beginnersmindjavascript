      "Around a year ago, I didn't know the difference between HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, or anything else related to how websites, apps, software, data, and all that works. I had always thought of programming as something too complex and cryptic to pursue as a career, but I had spent countless hours making travel blogs on wordpress and squarespace, and wireframes of other blog designs over the years.",
      "From 19-29, I had the coolest jobs I could have dreamed of. I led backpacking trips in the Rocky and Appalachian mountains, semester abroad trips in Hawaii, India, Tanzania, New Zealand, Australia, and Fiji, and summer trips in Italy, Thailand, Tanzania, and at a wolf sanctuary in Colorado. I led kayaking tours in the heart of downtown Chicago, tutored students in some of the most underresourced schools in Chicago, and analyzed bugs (actual insects) in some of the most rural rivers and caves of West Virginia.",
      "After nearly a decade working in environmental education, outdoor leadership, international education, youth development, however, I was ready for a major change, and a paycheck that could pay for rent, bills, and hopefully, in the future, support a family.",
      "In the first three months, learning to code was a side project, after work, learning Python for about 5-10 hours a week. I also read about Data Science, considering that path.",
      "I began to focus on JavaScript after hearing about #100Devs on Twitter. While I didn't follow the 30-week free online bootcamp, I watched about 100 hours worth of Leon Noel's old lectures on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I reinforced this with FreeCodeCamp, University of Michigan's courses on Coursera, and Colt Steele's courses on Udemy.",
      "In March, around 6 months after first starting to learn, I quit my job and started a full-time online bootcamp with Fullstack Academy.",
      "Throughout the past year, I have come to believe in the power of repetition and routine over inspiration. ",
