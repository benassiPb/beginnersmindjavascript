      "A year ago, I didn't know the difference between HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, or anything else related to how websites, apps, software, data, and all that works. I had thought of programming as something too impenetrable to pursue, yet I had spent countless hours making travel blogs on wordpress and squarespace, and wireframes of other blog designs over the years.",
      "From 19-29, I had the coolest jobs. I led backpacking trips in the Rocky and Appalachian mountains, semester abroad trips in Hawaii, India, Tanzania, New Zealand, Australia, and Fiji, and summer trips in Italy, Thailand, Tanzania, and at a wolf sanctuary in Colorado. I led kayaking tours in the heart of downtown Chicago, tutored students in underresourced schools in Chicago, and analyzed bugs in rural rivers and caves of West Virginia.",
      "After nearly a decade working in environmental education, outdoor leadership, international education, and youth development, however, I was ready for new opportunities.",
      "In the first three months, learning to code was a side project, after work, learning Python for about 5-10 hours a week.",
      "I began to focus on JavaScript after hearing about #100Devs on Twitter. While I didn't follow the full 30-week free  bootcamp, I consumed about 100 hours worth of Leon Noel's old lectures on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Between those videos, FreeCodeCamp, and Colt Steele's courses on Udemy, things started clicking.",
      "In March, around six months after first starting to learn, I quit my job to begin a full-time online bootcamp with Fullstack Academy.",
