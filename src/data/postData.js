      "This past spring, I had the opportunity to join Fullstack Academy's 17-week web development bootcamp. The initial few weeks difficult-- absorbing the breadth of content felt a bit like rafting upstream a roaring river.",
      "Luckily, I had Eloquent JavaScript, MDN, and YouTube to help me soak in the concepts I needed to learn to get and stay caught up.",
      "The first big takeaway was two-fold: 1) don't try to learn everything; 2) instead, try to learn everyday. My habit is to think in terms of big picture, relational-mapping, wide scope. With this pattern, I make plans more easily than I complete them. I make a map of lots of languages, tools, projects, skills I am going to master, and how they all relate to one another. In practice, learning a lot takes a a lot of time-- like years.",
      "In hindsight, this two part takeaway was among the most valuable and practical lessons of the bootcamp experience: to begin, narrow the stack (though at times it still felt like a lot to learn JavaScript, React, Express, Node, PostgreSQL, Sequelize, React Native, and NoSQL). Focusing on a specific stack, and coding for 6-8 hours everyday for 4-months without branching off into the basics of Python for a week here, Golang for a week there, and Java for a week over there, fostered a deeper learning and more useful skillset to build on going forward.",
    ],
    sectionTwoContent: [
      "I had begun learning HTML, CSS, and some Python several months before the bootcamp. All of this was done on my own, mostly watching youtube or following educational website tutorials. A second valuable aspect of the bootcamp experience was getting experience working with other programmers on a shared project. As a past educator and briefly admissions counselor who inititated multiple zoom conversations with strangers on a daily basis, I happily welcomed the one-to-one partner programming.",
      "When I felt lost, it was reassuring to realize that the vast majority of the time, so did most of my peers. Coming from a non-STEM college and work background, it was confidence boosting to feel on even footing with some really cool and smart engineers and mathy people.",
      "Additionally, working with a partner reflected back to me my coding strengths and blindspots. Certain errors would trip me up, and others would trip up my partner, but together, we covered a lot more mental ground. I also learned the value of openly admitting when I didn't know something, and asking a partner to explain something to me to help me grasp it.",
      "Finally, it was enlightening to learn what motivated others to choose this path, what aspirations they held, what outside resources they found most helpful. Some partners had multiple siblings who were software engineers, some were determined to work at Google, and others, like me, were looking for a career with more opportunities and intellectual challenge than their previous ones.",
    ],
    sectionThreeContent: [
      "The third phase of the bootcamp included two major group projects, which I've included descriptions of on this site (Grace's Greens and HappiList). Grace's Greens was the first project that required using version control and branching on GitHub. The assignment was to create an e-commerce website from a simple React skeleton. I especially focused on modeling the database relationships between users, plants, shopping carts, and purchase orders, building out the shopping cart page, and doing the CSS across the site.",
      "The capstone project was three weeks long, and open ended. We were encouraged to explore new technologies, and so working  with two peers, we decided to focus on mobile with React Native. We thought about mobile apps we use or find interesting, and decided on a wellness-themed app that allowed users to chat with friends, share photos, achieve a list of positive activities, post photos, and create lists. For just three junior programmers given three weeks to build an app in technologies we hadn't used before, the app came together surprisingly smoothly. The final few days included some communication breakdown, as one group member was working on their own deadlines and priorities. Ultimately, it was a great learning experience revealing how much thought is required to code and refactor different features within an app, and how valuable it is to keep things as simple, reusable, segregated, and easy to change as possible.",
      "The bootcamp ended with the unpleasant news that it takes graduates an average of 3-6 months to land a job. There are times when deadlines are helpful, and times when they are not. I am now nearly at that 3-month period, and it has been challenging to get interviews. Life keeps happening, and like a river, doesn't run in a straight line. Ultimately, the value of the bootcamp experience is still to be determined. But it did provide a pace of learning, a 500+ hour curriculum, a framework, a comaradarie with peers on similar journeys, and a feeling of confidence, accomplishment, and excitement for what lies ahead.",
